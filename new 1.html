<h4>Big wave surfing is a discipline within surfing in which experienced surfers paddle into,<br/>
     or are towed into, waves which are at least 20 feet (6.2 m) high,<br/>
	 on surf boards known as "guns" or towboards.[1] Sizes of the board needed to successfully <br/>
	 surf these waves vary by the size of the wave as well as the technique the surfer uses to <br/>
	 reach the wave. A larger, longer board allows a rider to paddle fast enough to catch the wave <br/>
	 and has the advantage of being more stable, but it also limits maneuverability and surfing speed.</h4>

<hr/>
<p class="red">The biggest, baddest waves aren’t born that way. Winds at sea generate waves that average <br/>
ten feet high; during storms, 30-footers are common. But what creates waves the size of office buildings, <br/>
including the ones big-wave surfers covet and coastal dwellers fear? In a word, land. A wave approaching a <br/>
shoreline meets shallower and shallower</p>
<p id="special_style">water, slowing the wave’s leading edge. Now much of the energy that had been propelling the wave forward <br/>
has nowhere to go but up, so the wave grows taller. Unlike the waves we enjoy at the beach, tsunami waves don’t <br/>
break because they don’t get steep enough. Energy distributed throughout the water column and wavelengths extending <br/>
a hundred miles give them frightening stability. They arrive as towering, surging masses.</p>
